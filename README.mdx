Welcome to this open-source Docusaurus template! This project is designed for hobbyists and developers looking to use the open-source Docusaurus framework, with a focus on simplicity and best practices.

- **Multi-Blog Support**: Easily manage multiple blogs within the same site.
- **Multi-Sidebars**: Use multiple sidebars to keep content well-organized.
- **SidebarConfig with Auto-Generated Sidebars**: Simplifies the process of managing sidebars by automating their creation.
- **Nested Categories in Sidebars**: Provides an example of a sidebar with nested categories to structure complex documentation.
- **Renamed Directories**: Directory structure has been renamed for easier understanding and navigation.
- **Documented Configuration**: Added comments throughout the configuration files to help users understand the setup and customize as needed.
- **Focus on Simplicity and Best Practices**: The goal of this template is to offer best practices while keeping everything simple and easy to use.
